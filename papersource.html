    <h2>PAPER SOURCE REDESIGN</h2>
    
    <section class="PSgallery">
      <p>For my class, Interaction Design I & II, we had to choose a website to redesign, and I chose Paper Source. Paper Source is a stationery and gift store that has been around since the early 1980s. Paper Source sells everything from custom wedding invitations and greeting cards to gift wraps. Although it is not a small business, it is not that popular among young adults and teenagers right now, or really just popular at all. It has been one of my favorite stores since I was a kid, mainly because there was never anyone in the store, which meant my artist aunt and I could shop alone, and in quiet. Paper Source has a creative and eclectic feel in-store that carries over to its website and branding. </p>
        
      <p>Overall, I wanted to create a website with less general repetitiveness while still staying true to what Paper Source sells best: stationery. The paper overlay used in the background of each section creates an eclectic feel without overwhelming the user. New consistent typography and a sleek, new logo achieve my goal of creating a more simplistic design that does not overwhelm the user. Utilizing white space between sections with thematic colors makes the website look less minimalist and cluttered. There is a clear and consistent theme, with less clutter and call-to-actions. I was able to maintain the visual hierarchy and create a straightforward user journey by creating sections in order of popularity and importance. </p>
        
      <p>Additionally, the menu bar was overwhelming and consisted of too many sub-sections. To fix this, I eliminated repeated sections and sub-sections and combined different sub-sections to create a less cluttered menu. Using overlays such as paper texture, gold glitter texture, and gold stars creates an eclectic feel without the clashing of colors, which was previously a
        negative aspect of the website. Shapes such as stars, stripes, and other abstract shapes allow for the continuation of the calming, yet eclectic feel. Paper Source was an enjoyable and challenging website to redesign. </p>
